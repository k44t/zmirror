so the question is what to consider online and what to consider offline and inactive


currently, what I have implemented, is that partitions become ONLINE when the zdev inside becomes ONLINE.

but for zfs volumes I have implemented, that they become online when they themselves appear in the system, and not their content.

zdevs, the content becomes online, when it is taken online in the pool. before it is only present (inactive)

and that makes sense for filesystems or zdevs. but yeah. let's change things.
